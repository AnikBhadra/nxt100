## What is HTTP?

- The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.

## What’s in an HTTP request?

- An HTTP request is the way internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website.

## HTTP Methods

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- HEAD
- DELETE
- PATCH
- OPTIONS
  The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.
  -- HTTP methods are ‘GET’ and ‘POST’; **a ‘GET’ request expects information back in return** (usually in the form of a website), while **a ‘POST’ request typically indicates that the client is submitting information to the web server** (such as form information, e.g. a submitted username and password).

  ## HTTP response status codes

  1. Informational responses (100–199)
  2. Successful responses (200–299)
  3. Redirection messages (300–399)
  4. Client error responses (400–499)
  5. Server error responses (500–599)

## What is DNS?

- DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser. These requests are called queries.

## What does DNS do?

1. Converts a request to google.com into an IP address.
2. Converts a request to IP address into google.com or some other domain

# What is a port number?

- A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. All network-connected devices come equipped with standardized ports that have an assigned number. These numbers are reserved for certain protocols and their associated function. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages, for example, always go to port 80 -- one of the most commonly used ports.

## Request header

- A request header is an HTTP header that can be used in an HTTP request to provide information about the request context, so that the server can tailor the response.
